\description{
A dataset containing MRM mass spectrometry-based lipidomics data from murine
serum samples. Mice were fed a normal or high-fat diet and had access to
normal drinking water or drinking water containing the bile acid
deoxycholic acid. Lipid peaks were integrated using Skyline and exported
results were imported into R using \code{lipidr}. The dataset has been normalized
and log2 transformed. Please see \link{normalize_pqn} for details on how to
generate this dataset.
