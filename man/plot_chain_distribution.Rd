\title{Plot logFC of lipids per class showing chain information
Plot a chart of (log2) fold changes of lipids per class showing chain
lengths and saturations. If multiple molecules with the same total chain
length and saturation are present in the dataset, the \code{measure} is averaged,
and the number of molecules is indicated on the plot.}
\usage{
plot_chain_distribution(de_results, contrast = NULL, measure = "logFC")
}
\arguments{
\item{de_results}{Output of \code{\link[=de_analysis]{de_analysis()}}.}

\item{contrast}{Which comparison to plot. if not provided, defaults to the
the first comparison.}

\item{measure}{Which measure to plot the distribution of: logFC, P.Value,
Adj.P.Val. Default is \code{logFC}}
}
\value{
A ggplot object.
