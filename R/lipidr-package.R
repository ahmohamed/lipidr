#' Analysis workflow for targeted lipidomics
#'
#' `lipidr` implements a series of functions to facilitate inspection,
#' analysis and visualization of targeted lipidomics datasets. `lipidr`
#' takes exported Skyline CSV as input, allowing for multiple methods to
#' be analyzed together.
#'
#' `lipidr` represents Skyline files as SummarizedExperiment objects, which can
#' easily be integrated with a wide variety of Bioconductor packages.
#' Sample annotations,
#' such as sample group or other clinical information can be loaded. `lipidr`
#' generates various plots, such as PCA score plots and box plots, for quality
#' control of samples and measured lipids. Normalization methods with and
#' without internal standards are also supported.
#'
#' Differential analysis can be performed using any of the loaded clinical
#' variables, which can be readily visualized as volcano plots. A novel lipid
#' set enrichment analysis (LSEA) is implemented to detect preferential
#' enrichment of certain lipid classes, chain lengths or saturation patterns.
#' Plots for the visualization of enrichment results are also implemented.

#' Description of lipidr datasets
#'
#' lipidr-package has 3 datasets: \itemize{
#'   \item data_normalized    Example lipidomics dataset,
#'     normalized & log2-transformed.
#'   \item lipidDefaults   A list of default mappings and annotations for lipids.
#'   \item lipidnames_pattern   A list of patterns used in parsing lipid names.
#'  }
#'  See below for detailed descrition of each dataset.

#' Default values for lipidr internal functions
#' A set of default mappings and annotation used internally to correctly parse
#' lipid molecule names.

"lipidDefaults"

#' Example dataset (normalized and log2 transformed)
#'
#' A dataset containing MRM mass spectrometry-based lipidomics data from murine
#' serum samples. Mice were fed a normal or high-fat diet and had access to
#' normal drinking water or drinking water containing the bile acid
#' deoxycholic acid. Lipid peaks were integrated using Skyline and exported
#' results were imported into R using `lipidr`. The dataset has been normalized
#' and log2 transformed. Please see \link{normalize_pqn} for details on how to
#' generate this dataset.

#' Patterns used in parsing lipid names
