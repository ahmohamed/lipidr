Description: lipidr an easy-to-use R package implementing a complete workflow 
    for downstream analysis of targeted and untargeted lipidomics data. 
    lipidomics results can be imported into lipidr as a numerical matrix or
    a Skyline export, allowing integration into current analysis 
    frameworks. Data mining of lipidomics datasets is enabled through 
    integration with Metabolomics Workbench API. lipidr allows data inspection, 
    normalization, univariate and multivariate analysis, displaying informative
    visualizations. lipidr also implements a novel Lipid Set Enrichment 
    Analysis (LSEA), harnessing molecular information such as lipid class, 
    total chain length and unsaturation.
