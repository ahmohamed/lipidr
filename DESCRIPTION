Description: lipidr an easy-to-use R package implementing a complete workflow 
    for downstream analysis of lipidomics data. lipidr parses results exported 
    from Skyline directly into R, allowing integration into current analysis 
    frameworks. lipidr allows data inspection, normalization, univariate and
    multivariate analysis, displaying informative visualizations. lipidr also
    implements a novel Lipid Set Enrichment Analysis (LSEA), harnessing 
    molecular information such as lipid class, chain length and unsaturation.
